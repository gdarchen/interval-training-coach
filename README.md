# Interval training coach

### Goal 

This app is a personal project used for my running trainings.

While preparing myself to run the Paris Marathon 2020, I had to follow up a precise training program.
Each training was precisely written up on a document that was customized depending on my performance on previous races, the amount of trainings per week, etc.

For each training, I had to achieve various periods, running at various speed during a specified duration.

However, I did not manage to find a tool that could remember those running periods and guide myself during a run.

This is why I developed this tool.
